==== Unassigned Counter ====
The extension is designed to show you the number of tickets that
have not been assigned (Escaled + Unassiged). The number should
display as the icon in the uservoice tab. It is set to update
automatically.

==== Quick Keys ====
alt + Q : focus on persal queue (tickets assigned to you)
alt + I : focus on unassigned queue
alt + M : focus on Message pane (start typing response)
alt + N : focus on Note pane (start typing note)

==== Hide Messages ====
alt + A : collapse all messages
alt + Z : expand all messages
Click on avatar : expand or collapse single messages

NOTE: Due to the way that UV loads threads you will almost always have to press
      either alt+a or alt+z before you are able to click on an avitar to expand
      a particular message.
